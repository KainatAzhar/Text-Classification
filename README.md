# Text Classification with a Fine-Tuned BERT Model

### Project Overview
This project showcases a modern approach to Natural Language Processing (NLP) by fine-tuning a pre-trained **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** model for a specific text classification task. Unlike traditional models that rely on hand-crafted features, BERT learns contextual relationships between words, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

### Dataset
The model is fine-tuned on the **IMDb movie review dataset**, which contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative. This dataset is a standard benchmark for sentiment analysis, allowing for the demonstration of a robust classification model.

### Methodology
1.  **Tokenization and Encoding:** The raw text data is preprocessed using BERT's specialized tokenizer. It converts text into a numerical format that the model can understand, including `input_ids` and `attention_masks`.
2.  **Model Loading:** A pre-trained `BertForSequenceClassification` model is loaded from the Hugging Face Transformers library. This powerful base model already possesses a deep understanding of language.
3.  **Fine-tuning:** The pre-trained model is fine-tuned on the IMDb dataset. The model's final layers are updated to adapt to the specific sentiment classification task.
4.  **Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained for a few epochs with a specialized optimizer (`AdamW`) and a learning rate scheduler, which are best practices for fine-tuning Transformer models. Its performance is evaluated on a validation set.

### Concluded Results
The fine-tuned BERT model achieves a high classification accuracy (expected to be over 90%), significantly outperforming basic machine learning models. This project demonstrates proficiency in using large language models, a critical skill in modern NLP, and an understanding of advanced training techniques for pre-trained models.
